# Human Action Classification Project

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and related files for human action classification and activity recognition.

## Files

### Notebooks
- `human_action_classification.ipynb`: Main notebook for classifying human actions
- `results_of_human_activity_recognition.ipynb`: Notebook containing results and analysis of human activity recognition

### Supporting Files
- `pdf paper.pdf`: Research paper related to the project
- `s.png`, `si.png`: Supporting images
- Screenshot files: Various screenshots of results or interfaces

## Getting Started
1. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed
2. Open either notebook to explore the analysis
3. The notebooks may depend on common Python data science libraries (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, etc.)

## Notes
- The project appears to focus on computer vision and machine learning for human action recognition
- The screenshots likely show example outputs or interface
